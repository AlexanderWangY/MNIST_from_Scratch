# MNIST Model from scratch (with help from PyTorch)

This is a hand drawn digit classifier deep learning "model". It was made with help from PyTorch, especially their tensors and matrix multiplications (although in truth it was just the '@' that I used).
You can check out the notebook linked on this GitHub repository.

Some future adjustments:

- Add a convultional mask before training to add more attention to corners and edges
- Possible blur? How does that affect accuracy
- Add benchmarks for different combinations of CNs and Blurs and Dense Layers
- Add more Dense Layers?
- Make it customizable, so you can remove and add layers as you wish.
